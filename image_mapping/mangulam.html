       <b>Mangulam</b> , located at 25 Km from Madurai town, is a well known site for the presence of early Jain Caves and Rock beds in
        the hillock called Ovamalai. Systematic excavation was conducted at the potential sites of this village during the year
        2006-2007.
        <br><br> Potteries of Black and Red ware sherds, coarse red ware sherds, pieces of quartz stones, small sling stones and a copper
        coin (datable to 13-14th Century CE) were collected from the trench laid near Meenakshipuram. 
        <br><br> Excavation on the terrace of Jain caves exposed the flooring of a rectangular chamber and brick wall, made of 11 courses of 
        bricks. The size of the bricks is 35 x 18 x 6 cm and clay mortor has been used as binding material.

        The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology to conduct excavations at <b>Keeladi</b>, Sivagangai District during the years
        2017-2018, 2018-2019 ,2019-2020 and 2020-2021. The analysis of carbon samples collected from the Keeladi Excavations
        resulted as 6th century BCE (580 BCE).
        <br><br> Likewise, the date of Tamil-Brahmi is pushed back to 6th century BCE that is a century earlier than the hitherto held
        view of 5th century BCE. Which is evidence for the high literacy level that was well achieved in 6th century BCE in
        Tamil Nadu.
        <br><br> It is generally believed among the scholars that second urbanization observed in Gangetic valley did not
        occur in Tamil Nadu. But, the Keeladi excavations clearly suggest that the second urbanization too happened in Tamil
        Nadu in 6th century BCE.

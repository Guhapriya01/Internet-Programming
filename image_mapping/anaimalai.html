    <b>Anaimalai </b> is situated in Coimbatore district. The Department undertook a trial excavation of a dolmen at Manamboli, a
    village in the Anamalai Hills in the year 1969-1970. The dolmen was found on a road under formation on the way to
    Parambikulam - Aliyar Project.
    <br><br> LA small piece of iron point, probably of a pointed knife, was found during the excavation. A few pieces of black and red
    ware pottery with different burial type potteries were also found.
    <br><br>This excavation has thrown more light on burial type and the burial antiquities. These objects are datable to megalithic
    period. (1000 BCE to 300 CE).
